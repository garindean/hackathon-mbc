New task
- **Completely redesign the market analytics UI** to match the style and layout of Fireplace Pro as shown in the screenshot (dark trading terminal).
- The new UI is for a route like: `/markets/[marketSlug]`.
- The page must have:
  1. A **market header bar** with key stats
  2. A **main content row** with:
     - Left: price chart & basic info
     - Right: order book + trade ticket
  3. A **bottom tab strip** with:
     - Trades
     - Top Traders
     - Holders
     - News & Events (placeholder)
     - Comments (placeholder)
     - **AI Insights** (this is our AI module and MUST be a separate tab/section, not mixed into the raw data tabs)

Think: same overall layout and vibe as Fireplace Pro, but wired to our own APIs.

Design requirements
-------------------

General
- Dark theme, high contrast, compact trading‑desk feel.
- Single page layout, full‑width on desktop.
- Use simple CSS or Tailwind if already present; no heavy design system.
- Reuse existing app header (logo, nav, wallet connect) at the top; the rest of the page should mimic Fireplace’s market view.

1) Market header bar (beneath app header)

- Full‑width horizontal bar at the top of the market page.
- Left side:
  - Market name (e.g. “50+ bps decrease / Fed decision in December?”)
  - Small breadcrumb or subtitle for the event.
- Just to the right of the title, show:
  - Current YES price (or main price) as a compact chip.
- Middle/right (horizontal stat row):
  - Expiry date
  - 24h change
  - 24h volume
  - Total volume
  - Open interest
  - Volatility (optional or fake for now)
- Top‑right of this bar: search input (if already available) and wallet summary (cash, deposit button, etc.) can stay in the global header.

2) Main content row

Use a three‑column feel (visually similar to Fireplace):

### 2.1 Left: Chart panel

- Big chart container occupying ~60–65% width.
- Upper left of this panel:
  - Market question in a slightly smaller font than the main header.
  - Timeframe selector buttons (1h, 1d, 1w, All).
- The chart itself:
  - Use any simple line/candlestick chart library (e.g. `recharts` or `react-chartjs-2`).
  - X‑axis: time, Y‑axis: price in cents/dollars.
  - Below chart: show volume bars if easy; otherwise omit.
- A small “Volume” stat under the title, like the reference.

Data source for this chart:
- Use the backend market endpoint(s) you already have, or add one like:
  - `GET /markets/:slug/price-history` returning timestamps + price/volume.
- If not yet implemented, stub with mock data so the UI renders.

### 2.2 Middle: Order book panel

- Narrow column in the middle (to the right of chart).
- Card titled “Order Book (Yes)” or “Order Book (No)”.
- Inside:
  - At the top, a thin horizontal bar showing **bid vs ask percentage** (“B 73% / 27% S”) like the screenshot.
  - A vertical stacked list of price levels:
    - Columns: `Price`, `Shares`, `Total (USD)` with depth bars for visual.
  - Show typical ladder: highest bids and/or asks.

Data source:
- Use existing backend Polymarket integration or add:
  - `GET /markets/:slug/order-book` returning best bids/asks.
- If backend is not ready, fill with temporary static data.

### 2.3 Right: Trade ticket

- Right‑most column, matching Fireplace layout.
- Top: Toggle buttons:
  - “Buy” / “Sell”.
  - “Market” (leave other order types as disabled or placeholder).
- Below toggles:
  - Two buttons showing “Yes [price]” and “No [price]”.
  - Numeric input for **Amount ($)**.
  - Simple slider for size.
- Bottom of the card:
  - Summary rows like:
    - “Total”
    - “If you win”
    - “Resolves [date]”
  - Primary button: “Trade” (for now this can be disabled or just log to console; actual trading is out of scope).

This section is mostly **UI only** for this sprint. It does not need to interact with Polymarket; it is mainly for the demo look.

3) Bottom tab strip (second row)

Under the chart + order‑book row, add a full‑width tab bar similar to the screenshot.

Tabs:

1. **My Positions** (placeholder)
2. **My Orders** (placeholder)
3. **Trades** (live market trades table)
4. **Top Traders**
5. **Holders**
6. **News & Events** (placeholder)
7. **Comments** (placeholder)
8. **AI Insights** (THIS IS THE AI MODULE – see section 4)

You do not have to implement My Positions/My Orders/News/Comments fully. Minimal placeholders are fine.

3.1 Trades tab

- At the top of the Trades tab content, show a small summary strip:
  - “Trader count”
  - “Total trades”
  - “Average trade size”
- Below, show a table similar to Fireplace:
  - Columns:
    - Outcome (YES/NO)
    - Type (BUY/SELL), colored like green/red
    - Price
    - Amount
    - Total USD
    - Age (e.g. “1m”, “3h”)
    - Trader (wallet short address or name)
- Add filters above the table:
  - Dropdowns for Amount (All), Side (All), Outcome (All).
  - Search field “Search by wallet address”.

Data source:
- Calls backend endpoint e.g. `GET /markets/:slug/trades`.

3.2 Top Traders tab

- Table of wallets that traded this market:
  - Columns:
    - Trader (pseudonym + address)
    - Position (YES/NO, size)
    - Avg entry price
    - Current price
    - Realized/Unrealized PnL
    - First entry time
  - Button or link in each row: “View profile” → `/traders/[wallet]`.
  - Another button: “Copy trader” (opens copy‑strategy preview modal or links to trader profile with copy panel).

Data source:
- `GET /markets/:slug/leaderboard` existing backend endpoint.

3.3 Holders tab

- Similar to Top Traders, but focused on holders and current size:
  - Wallet, position size, total value, avg entry, etc.
- Can reuse the same data from leaderboard but sorted differently.

Other tabs (My Positions, My Orders, News & Events, Comments) can be thin placeholders.

4) AI module – separate “AI Insights” tab
------------------------------------------

This is important: **AI goes in its own section**, not mixed into Trades/Top Traders/Holders.

“AI Insights” tab content:

Layout:

- Column layout inside this tab:

  1. **AI Summary card**
     - Title: “AI mispricing insight”.
     - Show:
       - AI recommended side: “Buy YES” or “Sell NO”.
       - AI fair price vs current market price.
       - Edge percentage (e.g. “+12.5% estimated edge”).
       - Short explanation paragraph or 3 bullets.

  2. **AI Strategy suggestion**
     - Card titled “Suggested allocation”.
     - Inputs:
       - Numeric `maxAllocation` in USDC (how much the user wants to put into this market).
       - Risk level buttons (Low / Medium / High).
     - Output:
       - Recommended allocation amount for this specific market.
       - Button: “Create strategy intent”.

  3. **Execute on Base**
     - When the user clicks “Create strategy intent”:
       - If no wallet connected:
         - Show message “Connect wallet above to execute on Base”.
       - If wallet is connected:
         - Call backend endpoint (you can reuse `/execute-strategy` or create a dedicated one):

           Example payload:
           ```ts
           {
             userAddress: <connected wallet>,
             topicId: "SINGLE_MARKET_<marketSlug>",
             marketIds: [marketSlug],
             usdcAllocations: [maxAllocation],
             edgeBps: [computedEdgeBps],
             riskLevel: selectedRisk
           }
           ```

         - Show loading state while waiting.
         - On success display:
           - Tx hash.
           - Link to `https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/<hash>`.

Backend assumption (AI):
- You can add a dedicated endpoint:

  - `GET /markets/:slug/ai-insights` returning:
    ```json
    {
      "marketId": "slug-or-id",
      "recommendedSide": "YES" | "NO",
      "aiFairPrice": 0.0-1.0,
      "marketPrice": 0.0-1.0,
      "edgeBps": 1234,
      "explanation": "short natural language description"
    }
    ```

- This endpoint can internally call your existing AI mispricing module (topic based), or be stubbed with sample data for now. The frontend should be written against this shape.

Implementation details
----------------------

Tech stack constraints:
- This is in a Next.js 14 App Router project.
- Use:
  - `react-query` for data fetching & caching.
  - `axios` instance (`src/lib/api.ts`) for HTTP.
  - `wagmi` `useAccount` for wallet address.
- Organize page code as:

  - `src/app/markets/[marketSlug]/page.tsx`
    - Fetches core market data & passes to a `MarketLayout` component.
  - Separate components under `src/components/markets/`:
    - `MarketHeader.tsx`
    - `MarketChartPanel.tsx`
    - `OrderBookPanel.tsx`
    - `TradeTicket.tsx`
    - `MarketTabs.tsx`
    - `TradesTab.tsx`
    - `TopTradersTab.tsx`
    - `HoldersTab.tsx`
    - `AiInsightsTab.tsx`

Focus areas:
- Get the **layout and basic styling** close to the Fireplace screenshot.
- Ensure all tabs render and the “AI Insights” tab is clearly separated and functional:
  - It must fetch AI insight data from `/markets/:slug/ai-insights`.
  - It must call `/execute-strategy` to write a simple onchain strategy intent to Base.

Final deliverable
-----------------

- Updated `/markets/[marketSlug]` page implementing the above layout.
- New React components for each section.
- Integration with backend endpoints:
  - `/markets/:slug/leaderboard`
  - `/markets/:slug/trades`
  - `/markets/:slug/ai-insights`
  - `/execute-strategy`
- Clean, readable TypeScript code with minimal but sensible styling that visually resembles the Fireplace Pro screenshot (dark trading terminal, header, chart, order book, bottom tabs, separate AI insights tab).
